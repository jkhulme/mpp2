\section{Goals}

Whilst researching the problem and the existing software, and during the first stage of development a number of goals were identified.

\begin{itemize}
\item Improve existing capabilities
\item Visualise the model more intuitively
\item Visualise closer to the cell level
\item Animation of the data
\item Investigating which combinations work best
\item Add the ability to annotate the visualisations
\item Allow the ability to save and load the program state
\item Provide a full session history to the user
\item Data Mining
\item Making meta data accessible
\end{itemize}

During the first half of the second phase of development new goals were identified.

\begin{itemize}
\item Google docs style collaboration.
\item Searchable database of time series plots.
\item Manipulation and Exportation of data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Previous Work}
Could move here from intro, could talk a bit more about how they could be improved.
