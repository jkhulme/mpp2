\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{First Evaluation}

The first evaluation in the second phase of the project occurred just before the halfway mark.  The group was made up of two people.  One who had taken part in the first evaluation meeting and one person who had no knowledge of the project.

As I did not have a domain expert available I was not able to do insight based evaluation.  I took a more traditional approach.  Before the evaluation I prepared a typical scenario that a user might encounter.  The task was to open a file, annotate it and play the animation, and attach some supporting documentation.  The task was prepared at two levels of breakdown.  One was a paragraph of text at quite a high level.  The second level of breakdown was a step by step instruction of each action to perform.
