TODO: HAVE I USED THE CORRECT PHRASE

Biologists often use computer models to help guide their research.  There are a number of tools available for their use.  Not all biologists have equal ability in analysing data and graphs, in fact, for some they consider it a challenge.  It is therefore necessary for these tools to help them relate the data to their field by incorporating domain knowledge.

One such tool that can be used for modelling is Bio-PEPA, an extension of the PEPA process algebra.  Bio-PEPA is currently implemented as a plugin for Eclipse IDE.  Bio-PEPA outputted data as time-series graphs.  There is one team in particular who use Bio-PEPA and are not comfortable with analysing graphs.  This team has provided the focus for this project.

The purpose of this project was to extend Bio-PEPA's visualisation capabilities to allow the previously mentioned team, and other users of Bio-PEPA to more effectively analyse their results.

In the first stage of the project a review was performed of the features of a number of modelling and visualisation tools.  This review included specialised software aimed at biologists and general software for anybody doing data visualisation.

Over the course of the project the scope has been expanded, a new aim of making it more effective for all users.  This was to be accomplished by adding in features useful to all.

The software that was reviewed was:  TODO LIST SOFTWARE

The features that were found in these were: TODO LIST FEATURES

The results of this project are: TODO LIST RESULTS

\subsection{Previous Work}

Early on in the first stage of the project it was decided to separate this project from the Eclipse plugin.  It was felt that Eclipse is not the right tool to do data visualisation in.

The initial development stages were focused on getting the new tool to match the ability of what visualisation could be done with Eclipse.  This is, creating the user interface (U.I.), parsing the results and plotting them on a graph.

After matching the existing functionality it was time to add new functionality.
WHAT NEW FUNCTIONALITY WAS ADDED.  WHY.
